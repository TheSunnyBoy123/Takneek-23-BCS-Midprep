    "Life\n",
    "Ruskin Bond was born on 19 May 1934 [3][4] in Kasauli, Punjab States Agency, British India. His father, Aubrey Alexander Bond,[5] was born in a military camp in Shahjahanpur, a small town in north India.[6]\n",
    "\n",
    "In a small school in the Jamnagar palace for their princes and princesses, where Ruskin also studied for his first six years he was an exemplary student. He taught English to the princesses of Jamnagar palace and Ruskin Bond and his sister Ellen lived there till he was six. Later, Ruskin's father joined the Royal Air Force in 1939 and Ruskin along with his mother and sister went to live at his maternal home at Dehradun. Shortly after that, he was sent to a boarding school in Mussoorie. When Ruskin was eight years old, his mother Edith Clarke[5] separated from his father and married a Punjabi Hindu, Hari. His father arranged for Ruskin to be brought to New Delhi where he was posted. He was very close to his father and describes this period (1942â€“1944) with his father as one of the happiest times of his life. When he was ten, his father died due to malaria, while he was posted in Calcutta.[7] He was buried in the Bhowanipore War Cemetery in Calcutta.[6] Ruskin was at his boarding school in Shimla and was informed about this tragedy by his teacher. He was thoroughly heartbroken. Later, he was raised in Dehradun.\n",
    "\n",
    "He attended Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, graduating in 1951. He won several writing competitions in the school including the Irwin Divinity Prize and the Hailey Literature Prize. He wrote one of his first short stories, \"Untouchable\", at the age of sixteen in 1951.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following his high school education he went to his aunt's home in the Channel Islands in 1951 for better prospects and stayed there for two years. In London when he was 17 years old, he started writing his first novel, The Room on the Roof, the semi-autobiographical story of the orphaned Anglo-Indian boy named Rusty; he did various jobs for a living. It won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, (1957) awarded to a British Commonwealth writer under 30. He moved to London and worked in a photo studio while searching for a publisher. After getting it published, Bond used the advance money to pay the sea passage to Bombay and settle in Dehradun.[8]\n",
    "\n",
    "He worked for a few years freelancing from Delhi and Dehradun.[9] He sustained himself financially by writing short stories and poems for newspapers and magazines. On his youth, he said, \"Sometimes I got lucky and some [work] got selected and I earned a few hundred rupees. Since I was in my 20s and didn't have any responsibilities I was just happy to be doing what I loved doing best.\"[8] In 1963, he went to live in Mussoorie because besides liking the place, it was close to the editors and publishers in Delhi. He edited a magazine for four years. In the 1980s, Penguin set up in India and approached him to write some books. He had written Vagrants in the Valley in 1956, as a sequel to The Room on the Roof. These two novels were published in one volume by Penguin India in 1993. The following year a collection of his non-fiction writings, The Best of Ruskin Bond was published by Penguin India. His interest in supernatural fiction led him to write popular titles such as Ghost Stories from the Raj, A Season of Ghosts, and A Face in the Dark and other Hauntings. Since then he has written over five hundred short stories, essays and novels, including The Blue Umbrella, Funny Side Up, A Flight of Pigeons(Hindi film junoon was based on this story) and more than 50 books for children. He has also published his autobiography: Scenes from a Writer's Life describes his formative years growing up in Anglo-India and a further autobiography, Lone Fox Dancing, was published in 2017. The Lamp is Lit is a collection of essays and episodes from his journal.\n",

    "Ruskin Bond with his sister, Ellen. This photograph dates back to 1938.\n",
    "Since 1963 he has lived as a freelance writer in Mussoorie, a town in the Himalayan foothills in Uttarakhand where he lives with his adoptive family in Landour, Mussoorie's Ivy Cottage, which has been his home since 1980.[10][11] Asked what he likes the most about his life, he said, \"That I have been able to write for so long. I started at the age of 17 or 18 and I am still writing. If I were not a professional writer who was getting published I would still write.\"[12]\n",
    "\n",
    "His sister Ellen lived in Ludhiana with his stepsister until she died in 2014. He also has a brother, William, who lives in Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing life\n",
    "Most of his works are influenced by life in the hill stations at the foothills of the Himalayas, where he spent his childhood.The Room on the Roof, was written when he was 17 and published when he was 22. It was partly based on his experiences at Dehradun, in his small rented room on the roof, and his friends. His earlier works were written without it being meant for any particular readership.[12][13] His first children's book, Angry River, published in 1972, had its writing toned down on a publisher's request for a children's story.[12] On writing for children, he said, \"I had a pretty lonely childhood and it helps me to understand a child better.\"[14] Bond's work reflects his Anglo-Indian experiences and the changing political, social and cultural aspects of India, having been through colonial, postcolonial and post-independence phases of India.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Ruskin Bond said that while his autobiographical work, Rain in the Mountains, was about his years spent in Mussoorie, Scenes from a Writer's Life described his first 21 years. Scenes from a Writer's Life focuses on Bond's trip to England, his struggle to find a publisher for his first book The Room on the Roof and his yearning to come back to India, particularly to Doon. \"It also tells a lot about my parents\", said Bond. \"The book ends with the publication of my first novel and my decision to make writing my livelihood\", Bond said, adding: \"Basically, it describes how I became a writer\".[15][citation needed]\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a writer for over 50 years, Bond experimented with different genres; early works include fiction, short stories, novella with some being autobiographical. Later, he tried out non-fiction, romance[8] and books for children. He said his favourite genres are essays and short stories.[12] He considers himself a \"visual writer\" because for short stories, he first imagines it like a film and then notes it down. For an essay or travelogue, such planning is not needed for him. He feels the unexpected there makes it more exciting.[12] Bond likes Just William by Richmal Crompton, Billy Bunter by Charles Hamilton and classics such as Alice in Wonderland and works by Charles Dickens and Mark Twain.[12]\n",
    "\n",
    "Filmography\n",
